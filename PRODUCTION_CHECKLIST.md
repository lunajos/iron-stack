# Production Readiness Checklist

This document outlines the key considerations for deploying the Iron Stack infrastructure to production.

## Security

- [ ] Replace all default passwords with strong, unique passwords
- [ ] Implement a secret management solution (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- [ ] Configure TLS/SSL for all services using a certificate manager
- [ ] Set up network security (firewalls, security groups)
- [ ] Implement proper authentication for all services
- [ ] Configure proper CORS settings for web services
- [ ] Disable unnecessary ports and services
- [ ] Implement IP allowlisting where appropriate

## High Availability & Reliability

- [ ] Set up database replication for PostgreSQL
- [ ] Configure Elasticsearch clustering
- [ ] Implement proper backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting (Prometheus + Grafana)
- [ ] Configure health checks for all services
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for APIs
- [ ] Set up load balancing for web-facing services

## Data Management

- [ ] Configure proper data retention policies
- [ ] Set up automated backups for all persistent data
- [ ] Implement a backup verification process
- [ ] Plan for data migration and schema updates
- [ ] Configure proper logging with rotation

## Infrastructure

- [ ] Choose appropriate instance sizes/resources for each service
- [ ] Set up auto-scaling for variable workloads
- [ ] Configure resource limits for containers
- [ ] Implement infrastructure as code (Terraform, Ansible, etc.)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment

## Certificate Management

- [ ] Set up a certificate manager (Let's Encrypt with cert-manager, Traefik, etc.)
- [ ] Configure automatic certificate renewal
- [ ] Implement proper certificate validation
- [ ] Set up monitoring for certificate expiration

## Service-Specific Configuration

### PostgreSQL

- [ ] Configure connection pooling
- [ ] Set up proper WAL archiving for point-in-time recovery
- [ ] Tune performance parameters based on workload
- [ ] Set up proper roles and permissions

### Keycloak

- [ ] Configure proper realm settings
- [ ] Set up required identity providers
- [ ] Configure client scopes and mappers
- [ ] Set up proper user federation if needed
- [ ] Configure email settings for password reset, etc.

### Elasticsearch & Kibana

- [ ] Configure proper shard allocation
- [ ] Set up index lifecycle management
- [ ] Configure snapshot repository for backups
- [ ] Set up proper role-based access control

### Prometheus & Grafana

- [ ] Configure long-term storage for metrics
- [ ] Set up alerting rules and notification channels
- [ ] Create essential dashboards for monitoring
- [ ] Configure user authentication and authorization

## Operational Procedures

- [ ] Document deployment process
- [ ] Create runbooks for common operational tasks
- [ ] Set up on-call rotation and escalation procedures
- [ ] Document incident response procedures
- [ ] Create disaster recovery plan

## Testing

- [ ] Perform load testing to validate capacity
- [ ] Conduct security penetration testing
- [ ] Test backup and restore procedures
- [ ] Validate high availability failover
- [ ] Test disaster recovery procedures
